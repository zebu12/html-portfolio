  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there! 👋 I’m on a mission to level up — in both code and life. 
    By day (and often night), I’m diving deep into Java and full-stack web development, 
    building projects that are practical, secure, and fun to use. By dumbbell, 
    I’m working toward my fitness goal: building muscle and trimming down to my best self.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love turning ideas into real, working applications, exploring new tech, 
    and learning something new every single day. Whether it’s solving a tricky bug, 
    experimenting with a fresh design, or pushing for that extra rep at the gym — I’m all in.
